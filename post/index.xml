      <description>Creating a personal protfolio web page was on my list for 2021, after a first attempt using Google Pages - nice but very limited - and a second attempt using Wordpress - which never came out of testing and fiddling around - this is how I&amp;rsquo;ll move on.

Why? Well, why, obvious - a place to share with you services that I do offer and give you a place to find me.</description>
